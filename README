jmake script options:

Usage: ./jmake [mode] [optional-args]

where modes include:

compile
	This will compile the source code and create the executable jar file
	SiGL/bin/sigl.jar

	Files in SiGL/resource will be included in the jar
	Files in SiGL/copyrights will be included in the jar

	Any dependencies must be in the CLASSPATH, or in the
	SiGL/lib/dependencies.txt file.
	These dependencies must be found dynamically at compile and run time.

	[optional-args] are passed to the javac process


doc
	run javadoc over src code and place generated html into SiGL/javadoc

	[optional-args] are passed to the javadoc process


clean
	removes SiGL/javadoc/* [generated documentation]
	removes SiGL/lib/class/* [compiled class files]
	removes SiGL/bin/sigl.jar [executable jar file]

	[optional-args] are ignored


release
	make a release snapshot of your project

	requires the 'compiled' jar file
	jtag must also be in the path

	creates a directory release/build-[#]/
	creates a directory release/build-[#]/SiGL

	copies bin/sigl.jar to release/build-[#]/SiGL/
	zips this up in release/build-[#]/SiGL-bin.zip

	javadocs the source and jars it up in release/build-[#]/SiGL-javadoc.jar
	
	cleans the project then tars it up as release/build-[#]/SiGL-src.tar.gz


branch

	jtag must be in the path

	allows you to branch your source code
	makes a copy of src and resource in branch/src-[#]


**) the compiling stage tries to tag the source code - if you don't have the
jtag executable it may complain, but it will still build the code, but the
sigl.LibSiGL.BUILD variable won't be incremented and 
sigl.LibSiGL.BUILD_TIME won'tbe updated
